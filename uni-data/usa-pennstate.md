Health insurance is mandatory for all international students in F-1 and J-1 status and their accompanying dependents.  The U.S. Department of State requires all J-1 exchange visitors (students, scholars, interns, etc.) and their dependents maintain health insurance.  Willful violation of this mandate requires termination of the J-1 status.

FULFILLING THE HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENT
