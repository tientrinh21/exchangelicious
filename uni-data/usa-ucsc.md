**[Exchange Students Website](https://issp.ucsc.edu/students/exchange/)**

UC Santa Cruz hosts exchange students (who typically come to the U.S. on J-1 Status) through two different programs:

**UC Santa Cruz Exchange Student Program –** This program is managed by the Division of Global Engagement at UC Santa Cruz and is specific to our campus. Students are nominated to participate in this program through their home university, which has a valid student exchange agreement directly with UC Santa Cruz. The Division of Global Engagement has established a number of these student exchange agreements with university partners abroad ([see here for a list](https://global.ucsc.edu/partnerships/)). Global Engagement manages the application process for this program directly with the student and their home university.

[**University of California Education Abroad Program (UCEAP)**](https://uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/) **– UCEAP Reciprocity –** This program is managed by a UC Systemwide office that maintains its own separate exchange partnerships with universities around the world, that serve all UC campuses. Students begin their application for this program by seeking a nomination through their home university, and can request to be placed specifically at the UC Santa Cruz campus. UCEAP manages the application process for this program directly with the student and the student’s home university. To see which universities partner with UCEAP and learn more about their application process, [see here](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/#who-can-study-at-uc).

# Location
UC Santa Cruz, located just above Monterey Bay on California’s Central Coast, is uniquely positioned at the intersection of technology and agriculture. Just 45 minutes from the high-tech center of Silicon Valley and 25 minutes from the fertile farmlands of Watsonville, our geographic placement has helped us practice our social justice values as we seek to develop technology for the social good. 

In addition, the Santa Cruz area’s diverse community and vibrant cultural scene mean students live among towering redwoods and misty ocean fog while also being close to city happenings, social engagement, cultural events, and opportunities for learning, growth, and recreation.


# Semester
UC Santa Cruz operates on a quarter system. A full academic year consists of three quarters: fall, winter, and spring. Each quarter consists of approximately ten weeks of instruction and one week of final exams. The summer quarter is an optional term.

# Courses
Exchange and visiting students have the opportunity to enroll in their courses before arrival on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Students are encouraged to work with their home university advisors beforehand to explore course options at UC Santa Cruz and develop a study plan that allows for flexibility in case first choices are not available. 

-   Visit the [**General Catalog**](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/index.html) to see all courses offered at UC Santa Cruz, along with brief course descriptions, and an indication of which quarter(s) each course will be taught.  
    _Note: courses are subject to change._
-   Visit the [**Class Schedule**](https://pisa.ucsc.edu/class_search/) tool to search for courses and see the actual course schedule for each quarter.

You can search for classes using the [class search database](http://pisa.ucsc.edu/class_search). Classes for the upcoming quarter are typically posted according to the schedule below, at which time you can begin planning your classes.

-   Fall classes, posted by early May
-   Winter classes, posted by mid-November
-   Spring classes, posted by mid-February 

_All students at UCSC are given an enrollment appointment – a designated time to sign up for classes. You can view your appointment time and enroll in classes through the_ [_MyUCSC system (student portal)_](https://my.ucsc.edu/)_._

Exchange students are given enrollment appointments during the “priority enrollment period” before their first quarter. Enrollment begins mid-July for fall classes, and late November for winter. The UCSC Registrar has [Student Enrollment FAQs](http://registrar.ucsc.edu/faqs/students/enrollment/index.html) and [Enrollment Appointment FAQs](http://registrar.ucsc.edu/faqs/students/enrollment-appointments.html) to help you navigate the MyUCSC system.

If you are unable to register for the course you want through MyUCSC due to prerequisites, you will need a **permission code**. Since UCSC has no record of you taking equivalent prerequisite courses at your home university, you will need to contact the relevant UCSC advisor for the department offering the class to address enrollment restrictions. To find advisor contact information for each department, search for the advising section of the relevant department’s website.

_Note: You can use the following templates to help explain you have the background to succeed in the class:_

-   [_UCSC Exchange Program template_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxCyqvXNA8OTcmdNOPUAJ_6kkKUiF46wIkQesoodpXo/edit?usp=sharing)
-   [_UCEAP Reciprocity template_](https://reciprocity.uceap.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/docs/prerequisite_clearance.pdf)

### **Department-specific Requirements:**

-   **School of Engineering:** Look for an email directly from ISSP with instructions about getting permission codes for Engineering classes with prerequisites.
-   **Economics:** The Economics Department will receive your transcripts and post any applicable prerequisites to your MyUCSC account based on the coursework you’ve already taken.
-   **Math:** Complete the Math Department’s [online Enrollment Request and Permission Code form](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/advising-resources-tools-forms/enrollment-request-form1.html).
-   **Physics:** Email [physicsadvising@ucsc.edu](mailto:physicsadvising@ucsc.edu) with detailed information (syllabus, textbook title, class outline, etc) that demonstrates you have the background for the class. Physics will post any applicable prerequisites to your MyUCSC account.
