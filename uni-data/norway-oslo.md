## When can I apply? 

-   We recommend applying as soon as possible after you receive your offer to study at UiO:
    -   You will usually receive your offer in mid-May for the autumn semester, and in late October for the spring semester. 
-   You can expect to receive an answer to your housing application by the end of June/November.

## What are the application deadlines? 

-   **1 June** for students starting their studies in the autumn semester.
-   **1 November** for students starting their studies in the spring semester.

If you apply for housing after the deadline and/or with another arrival date than 1 January / 1 August, you will _not be_ prioritised for SiO housing. 

## Am I guaranteed to receive an offer? 

As an incoming exchange student you will be on UiOs _prioritised_ housing list, given that you apply for SiO housing within the deadline and follow our [guidelines on how to apply for housing](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/international-students/before-arrival/housing/how-to-apply.html). 

**The prioritised SiO housing list only applies:**

-   If you apply within the [deadlines](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/international-students/before-arrival/housing/exchange-students.html?revision=WORKING_COPY&link-check=true&axe-check=true&vrtxPreviewForceRefresh=20243630013621#toc3).
-   If your housing contract begins 1 August / 1 January.
-   If you apply for a single furnished room(lenke til info nederst).  

**Please note:**

-   Being on the prioritised housing list does not mean that you are _guaranteed_ to receive a housing offer from SiO. 
-   Students coming on exchange or traineeship _outside_ regular semester start dates, will _not be prioritised_ for housing and will be on SiOs regular waiting list. 
-   You are only prioritised for housing once: the first time you apply and sign the contract.
-   The SiO age limit does _not_ apply for students on UiOs prioritised housing list: you may still apply if you are older than 34 years old. 

## What are the housing options? 

**SiO housing option for incoming exchange students:**

-   Exchange students must apply for a **single furnished room** in order to be prioritised housing.  
    -   All furnished rooms include a bed.
        
-   **Fully equipped housing** 
    -   Exchange students staying for one or two semesters may also apply for fully equipped housing through SiO. See information about this on the web page for [Sogn Student Village.](https://www.sio.no/en/housing/housing-overview/sogn-student-village) 
    -   For more information about this option, please contact [SiO housing](https://www.sio.no/en/shortcuts/contact) directly.
-   In your housing application you must select "Yes" when asked: "Do you want an offer from us if we find available housing that is similar to the ones you have applied for?"

## How do I apply for SiO housing?

**Read the guide carefully and follow the described steps accordingly.**

## Other useful information

### Costs

-   Somewhere between  NOK 4000 and 7000 NOK in rent on a monthly basis.
-   The price of rent will vary depending on location, room size and whether you have shared kitchen/bathroom facilities or not.

Please refer to [SiO's web page](https://www.sio.no/en/housing/housing-overview) for further information about the price.

### Cancellation

If you have accepted a housing offer and choose not to come, you must notify SiO housing and cancel your housing contract. Failure to do so may result in a fee. Please contact [SiO housing](https://www.sio.no/en/shortcuts/contact) if you have any further questions.

### Internal moving

-   Exchange students are normally not eligible to apply for internal moving. For any questions about internal moving, please [contact SiO.](https://sio.no/en/Help-and-contact) 

### Family and couple apartments

-   You are **not prioritised** for family or couple apartments.
-   Due to **very limited availability,** it is unlikely that this housing option will be available from the beginning of your stay.
-   This means that you can expect to be on a waiting list for a very long time (longer than one year), for family and couple apartments.
-   We recommend you to check out the possibilities to rent a flat/room in the private market. You can find available flats to rent at [finn.no](https://www.finn.no/realestate/browse.html) or [hybel.no](https://www.hybel.no/).

### Health insurance for students from EU/EEA countries

If you are a citizen of an EU/EEA country or Switzerland, you must bring either the [European Health Insurance Card](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559) (ec.europa.eu) **or** documentation of private health insurance when you enter Norway.

If you have private health insurance, please clarify with your insurance office whether your coverage applies to Norway.

**We strongly recommend a travel insurance in addition.**

### Dual citizenship

If you are a student with dual citizenship (EU passport and non-EU passport) you must register with the police either:

-   as an EU/EEA citizen and show documentation of [European Health Insurance Card](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559) or proof of other private health insurance coverage **or**

## Health insurance for students from countries outside the EU/EEA

Students staying in Norway for more than 3 months can become [members of the National Insurance Scheme](https://www.nav.no/en/Home/Rules+and+regulations/Membership+of+the+National+Insurance+Scheme) (nav.no). 

Please be aware that it can take several months before you are registered with the National Insurance Scheme. 

**All students from countries outside the EU/EEA must therefore have private or public health insurance to cover their stay in Norway or until they have become a member of the National insurance Scheme**. 

Please note that this membership means "coverage under the health section". If you should get ill and need medical treatment, the insurance will cover this within Norway, but not in another European country. 

**We strongly recommend a travel insurance in addition.**

### Students staying in Norway for more than 1 year

If the duration of your stay in Norway is more than one year, you will **automatically** become a member of the National Insurance Scheme when you register as a resident in Norway with the [National Registry](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/international-students/on-arrival/id-number/index.html) (Skatt Øst). 

You will register for the National Registry at the same time as you meet with the police to order a residence permit card.

### Students staying in Norway between 3-12 months

If you are staying in Norway between 3 and 12 months, [you can apply for **voluntary membership** in the National Insurance Scheme](https://www.nav.no/en/home/work-and-stay-in-norway/foreign-students-in-norway). This will entitle you to social security coverage with regard to health services in accordance with the National Insurance Scheme.
