============================================================================================


Congratulations on your nomination! Your time at Kelley will offer an adventurous and enriching business experience—one that you’ll recall again and again as you move through your career as a business professional.

Read through the following information to discover what you need to do to start your semester-long journey as a Kelley student.

Apply to Indiana University
---------------------------

[Apply](https://sisjee.iu.edu/essweb-prd/web/sisad/apply/welcome/) to Indiana University Bloomington as soon as you’ve been nominated. You cannot be accepted into the Exchange Program without officially applying to IU first.

Kelley International Programs will notify you of priority application deadlines for your exchange semester. Please complete and submit this application quickly, as you will receive further time-sensitive instructions after submission.

As an exchange student, you will need to indicate on your application that you are a non-degree seeking business applicant.

When you apply, you will be charged a $65 application fee that will be credited to your bursar account once you are in Bloomington.

Once you’ve applied,  forward your application confirmation email to [Andrea Nikolova](mailto:ksabroad@indiana.edu)—she manages the Exchange Program, and will be your main point of contact at Kelley. Once she knows you’ve applied, she will help you with next steps.

### English Proficiency Scores

All incoming exchange students must submit English proficiency scores as part of the application to IU. These scores must be reported directly to IU; photocopies are not acceptable. Here are the scores you’ll need to be accepted into our program:



| **English Proficiency Test** | **Required Score** |
| --- | --- |
| **Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)** |  |
| **Internet-Based Test** | **79** |
| **Paper-Based Test** | **550** |
| **International English Language Test System (IELTS)** | **6.5** |
| **Michigan English Language Assessment Batter (MELAB)** | **79** |

You will receive instructions about submitting your official test scores to Indiana University.

### Academic Records and Financial Support Documentation

When you apply to IU, you’ll be asked to create an iStart account. You can upload your academic records and financial support documentation into iStart. 

Please note that any delays in submitting required materials will delay your acceptance to IU and your admission to available courses.

### Course Requests

After you submit your application, Kelley International Programs will contact you with information on available Business courses during your exchange term. Please submit your course choices to our office as instructed and include as many options as possible because many Kelley courses fill up quickly. You must enroll in at least 12 credits each semester and can take a maximum of 18.

### After You’re Accepted

Your acceptance packet from the Office of Admissions will arrive approximately 8 to 10 weeks after you have applied. In this packet you’ll find information on housing at Indiana University, and more.

The [Office of International Services](https://ois.iu.edu/) is responsible for issuing your DS-2019 for your visa. They will also run your orientation program.

**You should not buy your plane ticket until the dates of the semester have been confirmed and you have heard from the Kelley International Programs about the date of arrival for orientation.**

Mandatory orientation for international and exchange students takes place the week before classes begin. Plan to arrive approximately one week before the first day of classes.

Look at our [academic calendar](https://utilities.registrar.indiana.edu/calendars/nine-year/) to find out about exam dates, holiday breaks, and more.

For questions about your visa or orientation, contact the [Office of International Services](mailto:ois@indiana.edu). 

### Housing

If you plan to live on campus, you will reserve your housing through [Residential Programs and Services](http://www.rps.indiana.edu/index.html) (RPS).

The Kelley School of Business is located on the corner of 10th Street and Fee Lane. An IU Bloomington campus map is available [here](https://map.iu.edu/iub/index.html).

If you are planning to live off campus, you can find advertisements in the classifieds for single semester rentals through [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/).

One.IU is the portal you will be using to access your personal records while at Indiana University and you will not be able to access the rental ads until you are accepted and have created a One.IU account.

Send your housing questions to the [Housing Office](mailto:housing@indiana.edu).
