# University

San Jose State provides a comprehensive university education and offers 145 areas of study with an additional 108 concentrations. Quality teaching and small classes are a priority at SJSU, where tenured professors teach introductory as well as advanced courses.

One of the 200 top research universities in the nation, SJSU offers rigorous course work and research opportunities to more than 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students in eight colleges.

San Jose State's location in the Silicon Valley makes it an exceptionally rewarding learning environment for students. Silicon Valley firms and agencies seek SJSU students for internships, summer work programs and for assistance with research and development projects. Silicon Valley firms employ more graduates from SJSU than from any other university in the nation.

San Jose State University’s exchange student program provides the opportunity for students from our bilateral exchange partner institutions, CSUIP and ISEP, to study at SJSU for one or two semesters as non-degree seeking students. All exchange students enter the U.S. on an SJSU university-sponsored J-1 non-degree student program visa (except for ISEP students). If you have any questions about the incoming exchange to San José State, please email us at j1-visa@sjsu.edu.
