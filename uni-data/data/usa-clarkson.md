Each apartment includes the basic furnishings: beds, desks, built-in wardrobes, dressers, refrigerator, stove, and living and dining room furniture. Students are responsible for providing their own kitchenware, cookware, bedding, and linens.  Students will know who their roommates are prior to arrival. We encourage exchange students to organize what they will contribute to the apartment with their roommates before arrival. Students may shop online and/or ship items right to the International Center so they will be here upon arrival. There are communal laundry facilities in Woodstock Village, Riverside Apartments, and Townhouse Apartments.
