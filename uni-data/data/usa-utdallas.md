# Courses

Students may choose any open classes that they are eligible for in the course book
coursebook.utdallas.edu
There is a wide variety of courses available for both undergraduate and graduate
students. All students must meet any prerequisite requirements. Undergraduate
students are generally not permitted to take graduate courses.
All international students must be registered in a full course of study (12 credits for
undergraduates, 9 credits for graduates). Exchange students cannot register until
open enrollment begins. Students must have removed the holds on their account (TB
test, international orientation, meningitis vaccine, etc.) in order to register.
Although we offer a wide variety of courses, there are some courses which are in high
demand (especially courses in the school of Engineering and Computer Science). We
recommend students have flexibility and consider additional courses in case their first
options are not available.
