    -   Take a look at UNF's [residence halls options](https://www.unf.edu/housing/halls/index.html 'residence halls options') before completing a contract.  Students attending UNF for the fall term only should select the year-long contract; the spring portion can be canceled later on.

# Courses

Exchange students coming to UNF through the Coggin College of Business primarily take courses in the four departments housed in Coggin: Accounting & Finance; Marketing & Logistics; Economics & Geography; and Management. While a select number of courses are not, the majority of classes in these departments, pending eligibility, are available to exchange students.

The University of North Florida Course Catalog and Course Search system allow students to find detailed information about the courses offered at UNF. The Coggin College of Business contains courses in each of the following departments: Accounting & Finance; Economics; Management; and Marketing & Logistics. Please note, undergraduate courses are numbered from the 1000's to 4000's and graduate courses are numbered in the 6000's. Undergraduate exchange students may only take courses numbered in the 1000's to 4000's with the exception of MAN 4720: Strategic Management and Business Policy - this course is not open to exchange students. Graduate exchange students may only take courses numbered in the 6000's with the exception of MAN 6726: Advanced Strategic Management - this course is not open to exchange students.

[UNF Course Catalog and Course Schedule](http://www.unf.edu/catalog/)

## Prerequisites

All students must meet course prerequisites to be eligible to enroll in a course. Prerequisites constitute previous course work or knowledge that students are expected to have for a given course. Students can view course prerequisites on UNF's Course Schedule (above) by clicking "Search by Subject", choosing the semester and subject/course number, and then clicking "View Catalog Entry" or by reviewing the course description in the appropriate UNF Catalog (above). Incoming exchange students are required to complete a "Course Schedule Request Form" and submit a copy of all college level transcripts for prerequisite review prior to arriving in Jacksonville.

## Teaching Format

Courses are taught utilizing a variety of methods and structures. Some courses have 3 or 4 exams per semester, some require group projects and presentations, and others require research projects. Students receive a course syllabus for each course at the start of the term which outlines the grading system, academic requirements and policies, attendance requirements, and expectations for the course.

The University of North Florida does not hold "re-sit" exams. You should be prepared to take each exam at the time it is scheduled and not expect to retake it if you are unsatisfied with your grade. Typically, professors will handle emergencies on an individual basis.

## Credits

The average University of North Florida course is 3 credit hours. In order to maintain visa status, all undergraduate students (years 1 through 4) must take a *minimum* of 12 credit hours per semester. This is considered "full-time" enrollment for undergraduate students at UNF. The average course load is 12 to 15 credit hours, or the equivalent of 4 to 5 courses.

Graduate students must take a *minimum* of 9 credit hours. This is considered "full-time" enrollment for graduate students at UNF. The average course load is 9 to 12 hours for graduate students, or the equivalent of 3 to 4 courses.

If a course is 3 credit hours, the class meets in a classroom for three hours each week for the entire semester (16 weeks). Professors expect that for every credit hour enrolled, students should be preparing 1 to 2 hours outside of the classroom. This means for one course, a student will be in the classroom for 3 hours a week *plus* spending an additional 3 to 6 hours *per week* preparing for the course.

## Grading

At the University of North Florida, letter grades are assigned on a scale from "A" to "F." An "F" or "WF" grade is assigned to students who fail/do not pass a course. In this situation, no credit is awarded for the course. A student will earn credit for a "D" grade. However, in the Coggin College of Business, a "D" grade is not accepted as satisfactory completion of a course. Refer to UNF's [official grade scale](https://www.unf.edu/catalog/policies/Grades.html) for more information.

# Tuition

Exchange students will receive a tuition waiver and will only be responsible for paying tuition to their home institution.

# Housing

Living on campus helps exchange students to more fully participate in student life at UNF and have the true UNF college experience. Additionally, exchange students often find the UNF campus to be larger than their home campus. Living on campus is a much more convenient option to walk to classes. Further, there are many activities and events, dining facilities, and student activity areas on campus.

# Visa

All non-US citizens need a visa to study at UNF as an exchange student through the Coggin College of Business. If you are a US citizen and will be traveling on a US passport, please notify the UNF International Center immediately.

Students are responsible for applying for their own visas through the U.S. Department of State. Once a student is admitted to UNF as an exchange student and submits all necessary DS-2019 documentation, UNF will issue the DS-2019. Our office will then mail the student a welcome packet with a letter of acceptance and a DS-2019 form needed to apply for a J-1 exchange visa.

Information on applying for a visa to come to the US can be found on the U.S. Department of State website. We recommend that all students apply for their visas through their home country if at all possible.

# Eligibility

When an exchange student submits a course schedule request, the International Business Flagship staff must review each request. Staff will check the exchange student's college and university level transcripts to determine if the student has completed any required prerequisite courses before approving the requested courses. This process helps ensure students have the knowledge and skills to be successful in their courses at UNF. Students can research course prerequisites in the [UNF Course Catalog](https://www.unf.edu/catalog/).

# Requirements

## Orientation

## Orientation and Arrival

All Coggin exchange students are required to attend two orientations a couple of days before the classes begin.  One is the university-wide orientation for J1 visa holders, which is facilitated by the UNF International Center.  The other is the college and academic orientation facilitated by International Business

Coggin College of Business Exchange Orientation

Learn about academics and culture within the Coggin College of Business.  This orientation includes breakfast and coffee, tips and insights from previous exchange students, and a chance to meet UNF faculty and staff, and local students in the Coggin Delegation.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Term&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></td><td>Spring 2023</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Day</strong></td><td>Saturday, 07 January</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time</strong></td><td>8:00 AM - 10:00 AM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Location &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Coggin College of Business, Building 42, Room TBD</td></tr></tbody></table>

Arrival

**When to Arrive in Jacksonville**

All Coggin exchange students must be in Jacksonville by the *evening prior to orientation* (see orientation dates above).  Not wanting to leave home on a holiday or finding a cheaper flight on different date are not acceptable excuses for late arrival.  If you feel you cannot make it to UNF in time for orientation, consider postponing your study at UNF for a future semester.

**How to Get to Jacksonville**

Students should fly into the [Jacksonville International Airport](http://www.flyjacksonville.com/Home.aspx 'Jacksonville International Airport') (airport code: JAX).  There are several cities called Jacksonville in the United States, so be sure you choose the right one!  We recommend that you not travel to Jacksonville via bus or train, as these depots tend to be located in less secure areas of town.  If you choose to come to Jacksonville by bus or train, make sure you arrive during the daytime and that you have plans for traveling from the bus/train depot to UNF.  For suggestions on ground transportation from the airport to UNF, what to bring for your first night in on campus, and other arrival information, visit the UNF International Center's [arrival and orientation](https://www.unf.edu/intlctr/international-students/orientation.html 'UNF International Center') page.
