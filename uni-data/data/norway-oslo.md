You upload documents by clicking on the grey button on the middle of the page (called "+ Upload new document" (under the headline "Submission deadline").

As an incoming exchange student you will be on UiOs _prioritised_ housing list, given that you apply for SiO housing within the deadline and follow our [guidelines on how to apply for housing](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/international-students/before-arrival/housing/how-to-apply.html).

**The prioritised SiO housing list only applies:**

- If you apply within the [deadlines](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/international-students/before-arrival/housing/exchange-students.html?revision=WORKING_COPY&link-check=true&axe-check=true&vrtxPreviewForceRefresh=20243630013621#toc3).
- If your housing contract begins 1 August / 1 January.
- If you apply for a single furnished room(lenke til info nederst).

**Please note:**

- Being on the prioritised housing list does not mean that you are _guaranteed_ to receive a housing offer from SiO.
- Students coming on exchange or traineeship _outside_ regular semester start dates, will _not be prioritised_ for housing and will be on SiOs regular waiting list.
- You are only prioritised for housing once: the first time you apply and sign the contract.
- The SiO age limit does *not* apply for students on UiOs prioritised housing list: you may still apply if you are older than 34 years old.

## What are the housing options? 

**SiO housing option for incoming exchange students:**

- Exchange students must apply for a **single furnished room** in order to be prioritised housing.
  - All furnished rooms include a bed.
- **Fully equipped housing**
