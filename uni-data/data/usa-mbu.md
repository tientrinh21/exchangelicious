​
_Business/College of Management Courses:_
​
If you would like to take courses within the College of Management, the department reviews each students application and previous course work before accepting them into courses. Due to the popularity of their courses, they have strict pre-requisites for enrollment into their courses. You should check to see if you have taken the necessary pre-requisites at your home university before selecting any College of Management courses. Students in Business/Management should consider taking courses in Economics, Math, Communications, and other departments as a back up to your College of Management selections.
​
Restricted Courses: As an exchange student, you can take courses in all majors at your degree level as long as you meet the required pre-requisite courses. Exchange students are _**not eligible**_ to take courses in the College of Nursing, all courses designated first-year or intermediate seminar (courses with a "G" next to the course number), ESL, or internship & capstone courses.

# Expenses

Although your tuition and academic fees are waived there are other fees that you are held responsible for. **These _mandatory_ student fees are generally between $700-$800.00 per semester**. Your fees could be slightly higher if your curriculum requires lab fees. These fees are not waivable and non-negotiable. Your student account will be put on hold if you do not pay your fees during your semester/year at UMass Boston, which will also put a hold on your ability to obtain transcript from your studies at UMass Boston.
