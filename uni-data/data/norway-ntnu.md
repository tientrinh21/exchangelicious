# University

NTNU is an international oriented university with headquarters in [Trondheim](https://www.ntnu.edu/lifeandhousing/trondheim) and campuses in [Gjøvik](https://www.ntnu.edu/gjovik) and [Ålesund](https://www.ntnu.edu/alesund).

**NTNU has a main profile in science and technology**, a variety of programmes of professional study, and great academic breadth that also includes the humanities, social sciences, economics, medicine, health sciences, educational science, architecture, entrepreneurship, art disciplines and artistic activities.

The university's root goes back to 1760 with the foundation of Det Trondhiemske Selskab (Trondheim Academy). A merger in 2016 made NTNU Norway's largest single university.

As an exchange student at NTNU, you can choose to study in one of three cities:   
**[Trondheim](https://www.ntnu.edu/lifeandhousing/trondheim)  |  [Gjøvik](https://www.ntnu.edu/lifeandhousing/gjovik)  |  [Ålesund](https://www.ntnu.edu/lifeandhousing/alesund)**

Note that you must be able to find enough courses you are eligible to take in the city of your choice. You can only select courses in one city.

### NTNU do not accept free movers.

In order to apply for an exchange at NTNU, there needs to be an exchange agreement between your home institution and NTNU.

# Courses

You should decide which courses you want to take at NTNU before starting your application.

Students are responsible for ensuring that they meet the requirements for any courses they wish to take. Please read the course descriptions carefully to make sure that you comply. Students who do not fulfil the requirements may be denied admission to the course.

PhD level courses are usually reserved for PhD candidates and require special admission.

[Courses for exchange students](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/studies/exchange/courses)
Exchange students can choose from a multitude of courses at NTNU, but to find the right ones for you, there are some things to keep in mind.

Read "Choosing and changing courses" below before you begin.

## Choosing and changing courses

##### Choosing and changing courses

All of NTNU's courses can be found using the online course catalog**.** Please read the following before using the catalog.

-   When searching for courses, the box _Taught in English_ must be checked, and your campus city must be selected under _Teaching location_.
    -   If the language of instruction on the course page is listed as _English / Norwegian_, check with the course coordinator (listed on the course page) whether the course will be taught partly or fully in English.  

-   You can only choose courses in the city you will be studying in during your exchange.  

-   Make sure you have chosen the correct semester (autumn/spring) under "Course start". Most courses are taught only in one of the two semesters, but is usually taught every year.  

-   Make sure you are **eligible** for the course. Check if the course requires _previous knowledge_ and is taught in English. You can choose courses at any faculty or department, as long as you are qualified and eligible for it:

    -   If a course has *<u>recommended</u> previous knowledge,* the course is generally open to exchange students, but it is the students' responsibility to ensure they are academically equipped able to understand/follow the course content.  

    -   If a course has *<u>required</u> previous knowledge*, the student must have documented academic experience equivalent to the 'required courses' listed on the course page.  

-   Specific conditions:
    -   If a course page states that admission to a particular programme of study is required, it is generally reserved for students attending the relevant programme. However, exceptions are possible. Contact the course coordinator to inquire about admission.  

-   PhD level courses are usually reserved for PhD candidates and require special admission. All courses where the number in the course code starts with **8** are PhD level.  

-   Different course levels may be shown by different names:
    -   **Bachelor's level** courses may be called  "Foundation", "Intermediate" or "Third-year"
    -   **Master's level** courses may be called "Second degree level"
    -   **PhD level** courses may be called "Doctoral degree level"  

-   You are *not guaranteed* entry to any course. The faculty/department decides whether you get admission to their course.  

-   **Overlapping courses?** You will not get double credits for courses with overlapping contents. Each course page lists what other courses its content overlaps with, under _Credit reductions_.  

-   If a course is project-based, it can normally be supervised in English, even though the language of instruction is Norwegian.  

-   You can freely change your study plan/course selection at NTNU until 15 september (autumn) or 1 February (spring).

### Proof of financing for non-EU nationals

Students who are not citizens of an EU/EEA country need to document a certain amount of money in a Norwegian bank account in order to be granted a student residence permit / visa to Norway. For the 2022 intake this amount is NOK 128 887,- for one academic year and NOK 65 000 for one semester. The Norwegian Immigration Authorities (UDI) enforce this rule strictly and will not accept other means of documentation such as a bank statement from a bank in your home country or financial guarantees from relatives or others. Accepted student will receive more information from the NTNU International Office about this together with their invitation letter.

Please note that non-EU/non-EEA/non-EFTA citizens with Erasmus+ Scholarships from a European university will only need to enclose documentation for this scholarship when they apply for a student visa.

# Housing

### Housing for international students

Please visit the [Life and housing section](https://www.ntnu.edu/lifeandhousing) for more information.

Normally, all students are allocated student housing in the spring semester. Housing offers are sent only **when all students** have received admission. This is normally at the beginning/middle of July for the autumn semester, or in the beginning of December for the spring semester.

# Visa

## Learning Agreements

### What is a Learning Agreement (LA)?

A **Learning Agreement (LA)** is a three-way agreement between you, your home institution and the receiving institution (NTNU) about the planned learning outcome/academic contents of your exchange.

The LA specifies which courses you will be taking at NTNU and, when signed by all three parties, it:

1.  Verifies that your home institution will accept the chosen courses (or professional practice) as part of your degree, replacing equivalent academic work you would usually have done at the home institution.
2.  Verifies that NTNU has approved the chosen courses/activities and will grant you credits for them.

Learning agreements can only be sent to NTNU, and signed, **after** receiving admission NTNU. Incorrectly filled learning agreements may be rejected.

To find out whether you should submit an LA or OLA, contact your home institution. You can submit one or the other, not both.

### What is an Online Learning Agreement (OLA)?

An **Online Learning Agreement (OLA)** is a Learning Agreement that is submitted through a dedicated online mobility portal, instead of sending it as a PDF. Many institutions use this system, which allows you to log in to a dedicated portal to send, change, and see the status of your Learning Agreement at any time.

To find out whether you should submit an LA or OLA, contact your home institution. You can submit one or the other, not both.

If you will be submitting an OLA, see specific instructions below.

### Filling out the LA

[Read here for a step-by-step instruction on how to correctly fill out your learning agreement](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/learning-agreement).

In your application to NTNU, you have chosen a number of courses. Changes can be made later, but no changes or additional courses will be processed until the semester begins.

You may **not** send the Learning Agreement before you have received an offer of admission to NTNU by e-mail. NTNU strives to sign Learning Agreements as soon as possible, but we <u>cannot</u> guarantee accommodation of internal deadlines at your home institution.

Before submitting your LA/OLA to NTNU, for your own convenience, please ensure that your home university has pre-approved your selection of courses.

-   Please note that OLAs containing the course **(“Norwegian for Foreigners”) cannot be approved until mid-August**. If you plan to take one of these courses during your stay, you must therefore wait with submitting your OLA. Otherwise, it will be rejected.

**If you have not had all the courses approved by NTNU yet, we strongly recommend that you wait to submit your LA/OLA until after your arrival in Norway or after 15 September.**

-   Online Learning Agreements (OLAs) can <u>only</u> be signed if:
    1.  All your planned courses have been pre-approved during the admission process.  
        **OR**
    2.  You have sent the approval of your newly chosen courses from the relevant department/faculty to **[exchange@st.ntnu.no](mailto:exchange@st.ntnu.no)**  

-   If your courses have not been approved by NTNU yet, but your home institution requires a preliminary LA before you arrive in Norway, **please send us your LA as a pdf-file per email** (find the correct address below). This enables us to sign the document as a preliminary LA with certain reservations.

### How to send the Agreement

-   Send your Learning Agreement in a **single pdf file** to the correct address below, depending on where you will be studying:
    -   **NTNU Trondheim:** [exchange@st.ntnu.no](mailto:exchange@st.ntnu.no)
    -   **NTNU Gjøvik:** [international@gjovik.ntnu.no](mailto:international@gjovik.ntnu.no)
    -   **NTNU Ålesund:** [au@ntnu.no](mailto:au@ntnu.no)
-   The _Responsible person at the receiving institution_ is the person you received your offer of admission from.
-   NTNU's Erasmus+ code is **N TRONDHE 01.**

### Making changes to the LA

If you need to make changes to your signed LA, you can do so by submitting the *During the mobility* section (Part 2) of your LA.

Changes will be signed, on the following conditions:

-   Any new courses with restricted access require approval from the course coordinator or relevant department administration
-   The "During the mobility" part of the LA will **only** be signed **after** the semester deadline:
    -   15 September (autumn semester)
    -   1 February (spring semester)
-   The "During the mobility" part will only be signed **once**, so you should send it only when your course selection is final
