# University

Founded by Swedish immigrants in 1891, North Park University now enrolls about 3,200 students, including approximately 200 international students from almost 50 countries. International students are an important part of the University’s commitment to being purposefully multicultural.

North Park is sponsored by the Evangelical Covenant Church, and this Christian affiliation drives the University’s values-oriented, liberal arts education program. All students are encouraged to explore how a perspective of faith can impact their studies and career, but our students are not required to ascribe to a particular religious tradition or participate in religious activities. North Park welcomes students who are committed to learning with and from people of diverse cultural, social and faith backgrounds.
